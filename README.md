# Beam

##What is Beam?
Beam is a small project I have been passively working on. The source you see here may be messy or incomplete, as I am using this as a learning exercise primarily.

##What enviornment is Beam built on?
Beam is built using the Unity Engine, with it's source written in C#. Feel free to take a peek around the source files and see if you find anything interesting

##What are your future plans for Beam?
While this project is intended primarily to increase my own skills, I would like to eventually get it moved over to a mobile platform (If you look through the source you might find some signs of this).
